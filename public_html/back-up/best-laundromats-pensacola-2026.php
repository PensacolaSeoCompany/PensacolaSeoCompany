                        <td>It is very convenient to have an app service as well as a quarter option to pay for the laundry and dryer services. However, the app has a minimum of $10 and it is always a situation where you’re passing through and just need a laundry instead of doing it in your hotel room. And there’s residual balance usually on the app and this balance is nonrefundable. Also, let’s say you need $6.50 of washer and dryer services. There’s no way to program the app to charge exactly $6.50. The minimum is $10. So if you’re doing just one load of dryer and one load of wash it’s better to use the machine in the back that has an ATM where you are dispensed quarters and you can do the old-fashioned quarter method as well. The app is not recommended as it keeps the residual balance without refunding and also has a minimum of $10 And doesn’t match the amount that you need so if you need more than $10 like $12.50 it doesn’t have the ability to charge that either. So it’s kind of a wonky app that they should do 50 Cent increments or something like that to make it more accommodating but they don’t do that either. They say in their terms of service that the amount you charge is nonrefundable. So seeing that the app was prominently displayed at the front of the store. Don’t assume that that’s the only option to pay. Have your cash or ATM card ready and go to the back of the store and get the quarters</td>

            <h2 class="border-bottom pb-2">Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best Laundromat</h2>
            <p>When selecting a laundromat in Pensacola, consider your specific needs such as operating hours, machine capacity, pricing, and additional services to ensure a hassle-free experience.</p>
            <h3>Factors to Consider</h3>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Location and accessibility for convenience.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Operating hours, especially 24/7 vs. daily extended hours.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Cleanliness, maintenance, and security based on reviews.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Pricing for self-service, wash & fold, and any bonuses or minimums.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Amenities such as Wi-Fi, play areas, games, vending, or payment apps.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-circle me-2"></i>Additional services like pickup/delivery, alterations, or commercial options.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Budget Tips</h3>
            <p>Opt for coin-operated or app-based machines for lower costs, or choose drop-off services if time is more valuable. Look for laundromats with loyalty bonuses or large machines to handle more per load, saving money. Compare wash & fold rates, starting from $1.85/lb at some spots.</p>
            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
            <p>Check recent reviews for maintenance issues or theft concerns, and prioritize staffed locations for safety. For families, seek amenities like play areas; for businesses, look for commercial plans.</p>
