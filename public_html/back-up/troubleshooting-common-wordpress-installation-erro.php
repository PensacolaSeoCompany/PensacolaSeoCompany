    <h3 id="common-wordpress-installation-errors">Common WordPress Installation Errors</h3>
    <p>When installing WordPress, various errors may arise that can hinder your progress. Here are some of the most frequently encountered issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>403 Forbidden Error:</strong> This error typically occurs due to incorrect file permissions or security settings. Ensure that your public_html folder allows access to the web server and that your .htaccess file is configured correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>500 Internal Server Error:</strong> This can be caused by corrupted .htaccess files or incompatible plugins. To troubleshoot, try renaming the .htaccess file and deactivating all plugins to see if the error resolves.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Connection Error:</strong> This often results from incorrect database credentials in the wp-config.php file. Double-check your database name, user, password, and host settings.</li>
        <li><strong>White Screen of Death:</strong> This is a generic error indicating that something has gone wrong, usually due to a PHP error or memory limit issue. Increasing the PHP memory limit in your wp-config.php file can sometimes resolve this.</li>
        <li><strong>Connection Timed Out:</strong> This may occur if your server is overloaded or your scripts are too resource-intensive. Consider optimizing your site by reducing plugin usage or upgrading your hosting plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Exhausted Error:</strong> This error signifies that your WordPress site has exceeded the memory allocated by PHP. You can increase the memory limit in your wp-config.php file by adding the line: define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');</li>
        <li><strong>Upload Limit Exceeded:</strong> If you encounter issues when trying to upload themes or plugins, it may be due to server restrictions. You can increase the upload limit by editing the php.ini file or contacting your hosting provider.</li>
        <li><strong>SSL Certificate Issues:</strong> If your site is intended to run on HTTPS but you're encountering issues, ensure your SSL certificate is correctly installed and that your website URL settings in WordPress reflect HTTPS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="common-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <p>Many users make errors during the installation process. Here are a few pitfalls to watch out for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neglecting to back up existing files before making changes.</li>
        <li>Forgetting to update file permissions after transferring files to the server.</li>
        <li>Overlooking necessary PHP extensions (such as MySQL or cURL) that may not be enabled on your server.</li>
        <li>Using outdated themes or plugins that are not compatible with the latest version of WordPress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="recommended-tools-for-troubleshooting">Recommended Tools for Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>Utilizing the right tools can significantly ease the troubleshooting process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WP Debugging:</strong> Enable debugging in your wp-config.php file to receive detailed error messages.</li>

    <h3 id="understanding-common-installation-errors">Understanding Common Installation Errors</h3>
    <p>When installing WordPress, users often encounter a variety of errors. Here are some of the most common issues and their potential solutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Connection Error:</strong> This occurs when WordPress cannot connect to the database. Check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file for correct database credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>White Screen of Death:</strong> Often caused by a plugin or theme conflict. Try disabling all plugins via FTP and switching to a default theme.</li>
        <li><strong>403 Forbidden Error:</strong> This indicates permission issues. Check your file permissions and ensure they are set correctly (typically 755 for folders and 644 for files).</li>
        <li><strong>404 Not Found Error:</strong> If your pages are not found, it might be an issue with permalink settings. Reset your permalinks in the WordPress admin.</li>

        <li>Not Updating Plugins/Themes: Outdated plugins and themes can cause conflicts. Regular updates help maintain site security and functionality.</li>
